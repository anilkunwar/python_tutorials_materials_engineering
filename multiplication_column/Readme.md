# In the data of velocities (m/s) and pressures (bar), if the pressure column has to be converted with numerical values in Pascal (N/m^2), the following python code using Pandas dataframe can do the task.

# The dataframe takes (reads) input data from fluid.csv file, performs the mathematical operation and writes the output in modified_fluid.csv file.
